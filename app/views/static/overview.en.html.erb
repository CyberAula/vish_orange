        is a social and collaborative site for creating knowledge resources for the realization of educational activities.
         The central element of the ViSH is the virtual excursion, a sequence of visits (enriched slides or viewgraphs), designed for projection in the classroom.
         Each excursion is a sequence of well-designed visual compositions (mash-up) of multimedia resources linked from the Internet,
         from the local ViSH repository or from other federated repositories. The name virtual excursion is a metaphor for an excursion in a virtual world of knowledge resources.
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="header_text margin-top10">
        Excursions are public HTML5 Web resources, accessible over the Internet by means of a URL, which can be projected in full screen format with a beamer to support classroom activities.
        Some examples of excursions are:

        The ViSH allows also the realization of collaborative activities and projects in the classroom involving teachers and students.
        The use of a shared account supervised by a teacher or tutor is recommended.

        One of the main goals of the ViSH is enabling collaborative content production.
        The basic mechanism for enriching or adapting an excursion somebody has produced is cloning.
        Therefore any excursion published in the ViSH can be cloned by other registered users for enrichment, modification,
        translation into another language or whatever.
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="header_text margin-top10">
        Excursions are published in the ViSH with a creative commons non-commercial alike license,
        where others have the right to use and modify the excursions for non-commercial purposes.
        The ViSH is contribution friendly and each excursion makes the authors of the cloning chain explicit,
        such that all who have contributed to a given excursion receive their recognition.

      <br>
      <div id="overview6" class="header_text margin-top10">
        When a user clones a given excursion a copy is made in the excursion area of his profile.
        The author of the cloned excursion and previous authors contributing to it, are added to the section “with content from”,
        such that authorship is properly recognized. The user becomes the owner of the cloned copy and can edit it as needed with the editor.

      <div class="header_text margin-top10">
          Excursions can also be imported and exported as SCORM objects. SCORM exported excursions can be imported in LMSs and other platforms supporting the standard.
          Excursions can also be accessed via an URL or embedded in Web pages, blogs or LMSs (Moodle, ..) like YouTube videos.

        Downloading of excursions for off-line presentation in a classroom or meeting is under development using the HTML5 offline mode.
        Excursions will only be enabled for off-line presentation, if all the resources the use can be cached in the client, i.e.
        if they are hosted in the ViSH local repository. Downloading of excursions as a set of PDF slides, but loosing all the active multimedia content of the excursion, is also under study.

        to interview people at the visited site or the result of a scientific experiment (telescope, microscope, accelerator, etc.)
        directly on the scientific infrastructure. Mobile devices can be used to walk freely around the visited site and show the most relevant parts of it.
